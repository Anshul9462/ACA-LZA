# Azure Container Apps Landing Zone Accelerator

Azure Landing Zone Accelerators are architectural guidance, reference architecture, reference implementations and automation packaged to deploy workload platforms on Azure at Scale and aligned with industry proven practices.

Azure Container apps Landing Zone Accelerator represents the strategic design path and target technical state for an Azure Container Apps Service deployment. 

This repository provides packaged guidance for customer scenarios, reference architecture, reference implementation, tooling, design area guidance, sample application deployed after provisioning the infrastructure using the accelerator. The architectural approach can be used as design guidance for greenfield implementation and as an assessment for brownfield customers already using containerized apps.

## Enterprise-Scale Architecture

The enterprise architecture is broken down into key design areas, where you can find the links to each at:
| Design Area|Considerations and Recommendations|
|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Identity and Access Management|[Design Considerations and Recommendations](/docs/design-areas/identity.md)
| Network Topology and Connectivity|[Design Considerations and Recommendations](/docs/design-areas/networking.md)
| Management and Monitoring|[Design Considerations and Recommendations](/docs/design-areas/management.md)
| Security, Governance, and Compliance|[Design Considerations and Recommendations](/docs/design-areas/security.md)

## Enterprise-Scale Reference Implementation

In this repo you will find reference implementations with supporting *Infrastructure as Code* artifacts. Currently we support one scenario named [Azure Container Apps Internal](scenarios/aca-internal/README.md), implemented with [Bicep](scenarios/aca-internal/bicep/README.md). More reference implementations will be added as they become available.
